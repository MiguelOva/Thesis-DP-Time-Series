From redirectpaymentinfo I want to retrieve column 'p_recurrenttoken' and column 'p_subscriptionid' 
The column that should be mutual on both tables is a column containing the cart code. On the redirectpaymentinfo is 'p_cartcode' and on the output of the initial query it is called 'CART CODE'.
Can you assist?
